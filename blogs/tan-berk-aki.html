            Kamala Harris's Political Future: California Gubernatorial
            Aspiration
          </h2>

          <h3>Kamala's Eyes on California</h3>
          <p>
            Kamala Harris is planning to have a shot at the gubernatorial
            elections of California. Last year, she became the last-minute
            presidential candidate from the Democratic Party, because of Joe
            Biden's sudden withdrawal after the disastrous performance in the
            presidential debate with Donald Trump. She had the chance to be the
            first female president of the United States, as well as the second
            Black one, but she lost heavily against Donald Trump both in
            electoral college and popular vote, although the odds were in favor
            of her. Some people blame her moderate political stance that aimed
            at centrist voters during her presidential campaign, some others
            blame the ongoing inflation and overall disappointment from the
            Biden administration, while many people point out the influence of
            Elon Musk and his Twitter on voters. In the end, the results were a
            nightmare for Kamala Harris and the Democrats. Not just presidency,
            but also the control of the House and the Senate now belongs to the
            Republican Party. Kamala Harris could not carry any of the swing
            states, and even lost the ones where the voters voted for the
            Democratic senators, but not for the Democratic presidential
            candidate such as Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin,.
            Nonetheless, this disastrous defeat that she experienced does not
            seem to stop her. Since the end of the presidential elections,
            Kamala Harris warns her allies and advisers to get ready for a new
            fight while telling her friends that she is still "staying in the
            fight". It is very unlikely to see her in the next presidential
            elections, but it seems like her eyes are currently on the
            gubernatorial elections of California which will take place on
            November 3rd, 2026. But the actual question is, does Kamala Harris
            have a chance to become the next Governor of California?
          </p>

          <p>
            The state of California is a solid blue progressive state which
            means whoever gets the Democratic nomination for the gubernatorial
            elections will likely to be get elected as the next Governor of
            California. The Republican candidate has almost no chance on winning
            at gubernatorial elections in this state. Therefore, the race for
            the office of governor in California is mostly a race that takes
            place inside of the Democratic Party primaries. The top two
            contenders for the governorship from the Democratic Party are the
            incumbent Lieutenant Governor of California Eleni Kounalakis and the
            former Democratic senator Katie Porter. Eleni Kounalakis was getting
            ready for the last two years and she was the first person to declare
            candidacy in this race. Furthermore, she also got the endorsement
            from major political names in the Democratic Party, such as the
            former Secretary of State and the presidential candidate Hillary
            Clinton. Nevertheless, she cannot get more than 10% in any opinion
            poll. Katie Porter, who is a very left-wing progressive politician,
            seems has more chance to win this election as she beats Kounalakis
            in every poll. However, since February, the opinion polls from
            started to include Kamala Harris in their polls, and it turns out
            that Harris easily wins the nomination with a great margin against
            all of her opponents, including Kounalakis and Porter. Moreover,
            both of Eleni Kounalakis and Katie Porter declared that they would
            withdraw from the race if Kamala Harris will join it. In other
            words, all of the serious contenders from the Democratic Party
            accept the nomination of Kamala Harris for the gubernatorial race of
            California and allow her to become the next governor of California
            without facing any challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kamala Harris still did not officially declare her candidacy for
            this gubernatorial race, but at the end of this summer, she is
            expected to start her campaign. According to a recent opinion poll
            from Emerson College, half of the Californians, regardless of their
            political orientation, believe she should race for this position,
            while the other half is definitely opposing her candidacy. Kamala
            Harris might have lost her chance of being the first female head of
            the federal executive of the United States last year, but this time,
            she has definitely a way greater chance to become the first female
            head of the state executive of California. Still in the eyes of many
            Democratic voters, she is a well-experienced politician that will
            finally get the position she deserves in politics, at least on a
            state level.
